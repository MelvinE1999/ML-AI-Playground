# Sentiment Analysis
Project that takes in input and uses the trained model to determine the tone of the input

## What I Learned From This
Truly I learned alot from this project. At the time of me writing this I am currently working on the AWS AI Practicioner Certification and took this on as a means to further my knolwedge and it has been really handy in it. I learned about libraries that I didn't know about like nltk, sklearn, and textblob while also gaining more time with the pandas library. On top of that I got to get hands on experience messing with stuff like the affects of random state and affect of the test size on the testing of the model, building document term matrixs (DTM), the Naive Bayes model, the Textblob model, accuracy and classification reports.

### Necessary Installs
> pip install nltk pandas scikit-learn textblob

### Need to know
- nltk libray
- pandas library
- sklearn library
- data frames
- Sentiment Analysis
- Document Term Matrix
- Naive Bayes

## Sentiment Analysis
Contains two different models TextBlob and Multinomial Naive Bayes and allows the user to submit reviews and recive wether it was classified as a positive or negative review 

## Sentiment Analysis Notes

## Multinomial Naive Bayes
Sentiment Analysis Notes file  with ability to be able to be used within Sentiment Analysis file

## Additional Movie Reviews
Stores some user generated movie reviews to increase data to train and test Naive Bayes Model
