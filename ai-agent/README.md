# AI Agent
Project that utilizes Ollama to run the llama3.2 model locally and create an application using AI to have an agent follow a prompt

## What I Learned From This
This project was rather small but was fun. It allowed me to mess around and see the affects of different prompts. Along with that while
I did use llama3.2 as my final model of choice this project was tested with llama2, llama3, tinyllama, and mistral models. Overall this was a good starting point for me in messing around in models and ultimately will be the backbone of my next project which will be a full fleshed out application that can do task prioritization along with setting timers for tasks, checking off tasks, allowing the user to talk aout their list with an AI agent, and much more all package up nicely for others to run if they want.
